A crowdsourcing platform which lets users create community-based songs. Users can choose to pariticipate in a designated part in a song: vocal, backup, or instrumental. With provided guides, participants record their chosen part and upload it. Then, different harmony parts from different users will be selected randomly and merged into the final song.

<h3> Inspiration </h3>
Our inspiration came from experiences as members of our high school's music club. As an Acapella club, without professional help, academic training or any advanced equipment, we always struggled to find the best way for our club members to harmonize together.

<h3> How we built it </h3>
We used node.js to create the server and Express as the framework. Then, we used Multer, a node.js middleware, to allow users to upload their record. Lastly, we used HTML to play the tracks and merge them together.
