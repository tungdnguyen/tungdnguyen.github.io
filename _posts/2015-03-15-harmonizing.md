A crowdsourcing platform which let users creating community-based songs. Users can choose to pariticipate in a designated part in a song: vocal, backup, instrumental. With provided guides, participants record their chosen part and upload it. Then, different harmony parts from different users will be selected randomly and merged into the final song.

<h3> Inspiration </h3>
As members of our high school's music club. Started as an Acapella club, without professional help, academic training or any advanced equipment, we always struggled to find the best way for our club members to harmonize together.

<h3> How we built it </h3>
We use node.js to create the server and Express as the framework. Then, we use Multer, a node.js middleware to allow users to upload their record. Lastly, we use HTML to play the tracks and merge them together.
