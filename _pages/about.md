<h1> tung d. nguyen </h1>
Hi,

I'm currently a Machine Learning engineer at Google Search, working on user query understanding and [Search Generative Experience](https://labs.google/sge/?utm_source=sem&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=us-search-sge-skws-exa&utm_content=rsa&gclid=CjwKCAjw_uGmBhBREiwAeOfsd8o6O0xzMW9mIG80dSOXBkSzhG7VfDRA7guFQrmF2uhHCR37uQWavRoCuKYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).

I obtained my **B.S. in Computer Science** (with Applied Math minor) from Illinois Institute of Technology. My past experiences included brand perception on social networks, AI driver assistance, and audio signals processing. **My main interests are Natural Language Processing, Social Computing, and Human-Computer Interaction.**

All my works are detailed in my [CV](https://www.tungdnguyen.com/cv/) and my [technical projects section](https://www.tungdnguyen.com/blog/).

I also have vested interests in various forms of creative work as well. Check out my other works [here](https://www.tungdnguyen.com/projects/).
