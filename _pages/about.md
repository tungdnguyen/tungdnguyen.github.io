Hi,

I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer working on user query understanding and [Search Generative Experience](https://labs.google/sge/?utm_source=sem&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=us-search-sge-skws-exa&utm_content=rsa&gclid=CjwKCAjw_uGmBhBREiwAeOfsd8o6O0xzMW9mIG80dSOXBkSzhG7VfDRA7guFQrmF2uhHCR37uQWavRoCuKYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) for Google Search.

I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science (with Applied Math Minor) from Illinois Institute of Technology. I worked under professor [Aron Culotta](https://sse.tulane.edu/cs/faculty/culotta) at [Text Analysis in the Public Interest](https://tapilab.github.io/) (TAPI) lab and published a paper on [estimating brand-perceptions using Twitter followers network](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341161.3343675). My main interests are natural language processing, social computing, and human-computer interaction.
